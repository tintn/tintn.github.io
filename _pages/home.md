I'm Machine Learning Engineer and a Physicist
- I'm interested in MLOps and bridging the gap between development and production in ML applications. I have experienced the frustration of getting models to production and maintaining them, the problems inspire my curiosity in production ML systems and how to better design them.

Want to have a chat?
- I'm always open for interesting conversations. If you are interested in MLOps or machine learning in general, feel free to get in touch!
