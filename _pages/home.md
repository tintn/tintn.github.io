I'm Machine Learning Engineer and a Physicist
- I'm currently a ML engineer at Firevisor Systems where I'm responsible for developing models for defect detection from solar panels. I'm also leading the development of the company's inference system to serve DL models on-premise and in the cloud.
- I'm interested in MLOps and bridging the gap between development and production in ML applications. I personally experienced the pain of getting models to production and maintaining them, the problem inspires my interest in MLOps and how to better design ML systems.

Want to have a chat?
- I'm always open for interesting conversations. If you are interested in MLOps or machine learning in general, feel free to get in touch!
